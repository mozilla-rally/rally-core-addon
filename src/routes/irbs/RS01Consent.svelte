<h1>Rally Study Consent Notice</h1>

<p>
  The goal of this study is to improve our understanding of how our community
  browses the internet, where they spend their time, and <b
    >how these browsing dynamics differ across segments of people</b
  >.
</p>

<p>
  To understand this we will collect data about your browsing experience. More
  specifically, what websites you browse (e.g., wikipedia.org), how long you
  view pages, how far you scroll on pages, when a page plays audio, and for how
  long audio is playing. The data we collect about the specific pages you browse
  is limited to the page title, description, and category. For more information
  take a look at our <a
    target="_blank"
    href="http://rally.mozilla.org/current-studies/your-time-online-and-doomscrolling/"
    >additional details page</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  This data is not aggregated before it is sent to our servers; this study will
  record all events. After we analyze our data we will publish aggregated
  insights on our blog or other channels. When we do so, <b
    >we will minimize what we’re sharing publicly by ensuring we aggregate the
    data</b
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Data will be collected through a custom browser web extension developed by the
  Rally team. We will install the web extension and data will be collected
  through browser data after you opt-in. Mozilla will store the data on Google
  Cloud where all analysis will be conducted. This server is restricted to the
  Rally team researchers and is encrypted. Data will be transferred by TLS
  between the participant's browser and the Mozilla analysis database. TLS
  stands for "transport layer security" which encrypts browser data.
</p>

<p>
  This study will be open for 6 months, and you can unenroll at any time by
  following the steps below.
</p>

<h2>Leaving the Study</h2>
<p>
  You can leave the study at any time from the Mozilla Rally options page. To
  access the page, click on the Rally button <img
    style="padding: 0 4px;"
    width="16"
    src="img/rally-toolbar-icon.svg"
    alt="rally icon"
  />
  in your browser toolbar. The button is usually near the top right of the browser
  window. If you have removed the Rally button from your toolbar, you can also access
  the Rally options page from the browser’s add-ons settings. The Rally options page
  will show you a list of studies that you are currently enrolled in. You can leave
  this study by clicking the “Leave Study” button on the associated study card. If
  you leave the study, the study’s browser extension will be automatically uninstalled,
  removing the study code and data from your browser. We will also automatically
  delete the data that your browser has submitted for the study, unless you allow
  us to retain that data. You may not be able to rejoin the study if you leave. If
  you leave Rally, you will also leave the studies that you are enrolled in, including
  this study.
